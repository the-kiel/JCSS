This is a cleaned version of the solver used for the experiments presented in the papers
"New Bounds on Optimal Sorting Networks" and "Sorting Networks: to the End and Back Again".

To use the solver, build this software like a normal minisat (see README file), and run

./minisat -input-Bits=17 -layers=10 -usePrefFile -prefFile=test.txt -betterEncoding -row=0 -useSomeValues -shrink=0 
for 
  - running the solver on 17 channels
  - allowing for 10 layers
  - using a prefix read from a file
  - this file is "test.txt"
  - use the new improved encoding (the old one is available as well)
  - take the prefix which is stored in row no. 0 in this file
  - start with some initial values
  - shrink the window size by 0, i.e. allow for all outputs of the prefix
