A small program implementing the simple evolutionary algorithm used to obtain the optimized representations of the
2-layer prefixes.

To compile: g++ -O3 -o prefix prefix.cpp
To run: e.g. ./prefix pb6.txt 6 0
        where 6 is the number of channels and 0 is the number of the lowest channel
        (we number the channels starting with channel 0)
